<h3>User Registration: </h3>
<br>
Collect user registration information (username, email, password, etc.).<br>
Hash and securely store the password using a hashing algorithm like bcrypt.<br>
Store the user information in a database.<br>

<h3>User Login:</h3>
<br>

Collect user login credentials (username/email and password).<br>
Retrieve the user record from the database based on the provided identifier (username/email).<br>
Compare the stored hashed password with the input password using bcrypt's comparison function.<br>
If the passwords match, generate a JSON Web Token (JWT) or session ID to identify the user's authenticated session.<br>
  
<h3>Protecting Routes/Endpoints:</h3>
<br>

Implement middleware functions to verify the authenticity of incoming requests.<br>
Validate the JWT or session ID in the request headers or cookies.<br>
If the token or session is valid, allow access to the requested resource; otherwise, return an authentication error.<br>
  
<h3>JSON Web Tokens (JWT):</h3>
<br>

Use JWTs for stateless authentication and to securely transmit user information.<br>
After successful login, generate a JWT containing the user's identity and any relevant data.<br>
Sign the token with a secret key to ensure its integrity.<br>
Send the JWT to the client, usually as an HTTP header or within the response body.<br>
For subsequent requests, include the JWT in the Authorization header to authenticate the user.<br>
  
<h3>Session-Based Authentication:</h3>
<br>

Store session information on the server after successful login.<br>
Assign a unique session ID and associate it with the authenticated user.<br>
Send the session ID to the client, usually as a cookie.<br>
For subsequent requests, the client sends the session ID with each request, and the server verifies it against the stored sessions.<br>
  
<h3>Middleware for Authentication:</h3>
<br>

Create middleware functions to protect routes that require authentication.<br>
Middleware functions intercept incoming requests and check for valid authentication credentials.<br>
If authentication is successful, allow the request to proceed; otherwise, return an authentication error.<br>
  
<h3>Security Considerations:</h3>
<br>

Implement password policies (e.g., complexity requirements, password reset mechanisms).<br>
Enforce HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.<br>
Implement mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks and protect against common vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).<br>
